### How to compile the guardrail script from source

To compile the current version of the guardrail script yourself, you first have to clone the plutus repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/IntersectMBO/plutus.git
cd plutus
```
Next we check out the version 1.34.0.0 of plutus and enter a nix development shell via
```bash
git checkout 1.34.0.0
nix develop
```
The executable `create-json-envelope` can be used to compile the guardrail script.
Unfortunately, building this executable is disabled by default (caused by a circular dependency).
To re-enable it you have to uncomment the following lines in `cabal.project`:
```cabal
-- package cardano-constitution
--   flags: +force-build
-- allow-newer: *:plutus-ledger-api
-- allow-newer: *:prettyprinter-configurable
-- allow-older: *:nothunks
```
Next, we can compile the script via
```bash
cabal update
cabal run cardano-constitution:create-json-envelope -- guardrail.plutus
```
You can get the hash of this just compiled script via, for example
```bash
cardano-cli transaction policyid --script-file guardrail.plutus
```
And compare it to the one currently defined [here](https://book.world.dev.cardano.org/environments/mainnet/conway-genesis.json).
